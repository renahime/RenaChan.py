RenaBot is a customizable Discord bot created to help users set up their own bots without extensive programming knowledge. It provides an easy-to-use setup process that requires the bot token and user ID, allowing users to get their bot up and running quickly. The bot is designed to log data using a database and offers two initial functionalities: server information logging and a simple greeting response.

## File Structure

Here's the file structure of the RenaBot project:

## Activating Virtual Environment

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for RenaBot's dependencies, it's recommended to set up a virtual environment. Below are the steps to create and activate a virtual environment on different operating systems:

### Windows:

- [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Download the latest version of Python for Windows. During installation, make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" option.

- [Creating a Virtual Environment (venv) - Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html): Official documentation on creating virtual environments using `venv`.

### macOS and Linux:

- [Installing Python on macOS](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/): A guide on installing Python on macOS.

- [Installing Python on Linux](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/): A guide on installing Python on Linux.

- [Creating a Virtual Environment (venv) - Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html): Official documentation on creating virtual environments using `venv`.

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install RenaBot's required dependencies without affecting other projects or your system-wide Python installation. Remember to activate the virtual environment whenever you work on RenaBot to ensure consistency and avoid potential conflicts.

## Getting Started

To set up RenaBot for your Discord server, follow these steps:

1. **Obtaining the Bot Token and User ID**

   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
   - Navigate to the "Bot" tab in your application, click "Add Bot," and confirm the action.
   - Under the "Token" section, click "Copy" to copy the bot token to your clipboard. This token will be used during the setup process.
   - To obtain your user ID, enable Developer Mode in Discord's settings (User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode).
   - Right-click on your username or nickname, and select "Copy ID" from the context menu. This will copy your user ID to the clipboard.

2. **Starting RenaBot**

   - Run the `renachan.py` script to start RenaBot:
     ```
     python renachan.py
     ```
   - Upon first run, RenaBot will prompt you for the bot token and user ID required for setup.
   - RenaBot will create a `.env` file in the root directory and store the provided information for future use.
   - If you encounter any issues during setup, refer to the `.env.example` file in the root directory for guidance.

3. **Installing Dependencies**

   - Ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed on your system.
   - It's recommended to set up a virtual environment for RenaBot to keep dependencies isolated. To create a virtual environment, navigate to the RenaBot directory and run:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

     - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. **Installing Dependencies**

   - Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
   - Navigate to the RenaBot directory and install the required Python packages by running the following command:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Starting RenaBot**
   - Run the `renachan.py` script to start RenaBot:
     ```
     python renachan.py
     ```
   - RenaBot is now active and will respond to the specified command prefix.

## Current Functionalities

1. **Server Information Logging**

   - RenaBot logs the following information when it joins a new server:
     - Channels
     - Members
     - Server information
   - Additionally, RenaBot sends a welcome message to the server upon joining.

2. **Greeting Response**
   - When you use the preferred command prefix, RenaBot will respond with a friendly greeting ("hello" in this version).

## Future Implementations

The following features are planned for future versions of RenaBot:

- Database migration support for updating the database structure without losing existing data.
- Database Flexibility: The ability to choose between using a local database such as SQLite or a more robust database system like MySQL, depending on your needs and preferences.
- A todo list feature that will remind users of upcoming tasks and keep track of task completion.
- A "harass" feature that can send notifications or messages to specific users for important communications.
- Data collection and machine learning capabilities to provide personalized recommendations (e.g., fashion recommendations).
